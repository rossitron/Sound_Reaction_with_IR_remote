This arduino project does a 32 point FHT on microphone data (32 samples @ 730Hz on a atmega328 @ 16MHz) and drives 3 PWM pins hooked up to RGB LEDs.
Supports reading from IR remote control buttons.

Only tested on Arduino ATmega328. But should run on other ATmega hardware with minor tweaks.
Currently under heavy development... Code clean up is under way. New features to come. RF data linking between units.
Teensy 3.1 port soon (for larger FHT bin size while still oversampling).
